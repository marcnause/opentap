## Contributing Code

Once you have signed the CLA, project maintainers will review and accept pull requests containing fixes and enhancements to OpenTAP code and/or documentation.

In the issue tracker, the label `Accepting Merge Requests` indicates that OpenTAP project maintainers explicitly agree that the issue is valid and are looking for help creating a PR (Pull Request - other contributions are also welcome).

1. Identify an existing issue you want to work on, or submit a new one
2. Consult your peers in the community to seek consensus on the issue resolution. Having multiple sponsors for a change or enhancement makes it easier for the project maintainers to accept the contribution 
3. Assign the issue to yourself
4. Fork the repository
5. Develop and test, then commit changes
6. Submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) back to [the root of the fork network](https://github.com/opentap/opentap)
